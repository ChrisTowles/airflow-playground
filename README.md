# Airflow with ECS (Proof of Concept)

I built this Repo as part of Proof of Concept for my blog posts:

- https://chris.towles.me/blog/apache-airflow-part-1-why-and-goals


## Purpose

Goal to work out some best practices with Airflow using ECS for work.

I have a requirement to run in AWS us-gov-east-1 so [MWAA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/mwaa.html) is not an option in that AWS Region.
